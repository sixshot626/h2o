/**
 * <p>
 * An implementation of {@link LongStream} which uses a custom {@link ForkJoinPool} for parallel aggregate operations.
 * This is the {@code long} primitive specialization of {@link ParallelStreamSupport}.
 * <p>
 * The following example illustrates an aggregate operation using {@link ParallelStreamSupport} and
 * {@link ParallelLongStreamSupport} with a custom {@link ForkJoinPool}, computing the sum of the weights of the red
 * widgets:
 * <pre>
 * ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
 * long sum = ParallelStreamSupport.parallelStream(widgets, pool)
 *     .filter(w -&gt; w.getColor() == RED)
 *     .mapToLong(w -&gt; w.getWeight())
 *     .sum();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In case this stream is configured for parallel execution, i.e. {@link #isParallel()} returns {@code true}, a
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#StreamOps">terminal
 * operation</a> will be executed as {@link ForkJoinTask} in the custom {@link ForkJoinPool}. Otherwise it will be
 * executed in the calling thread.
 * </p>
 * This implementation offers various factory methods which are based on:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The static factory methods of {@link LongStream}, which are meaningful for parallel streams</li>
 * <li>{@link Arrays#stream(long[])}</li>
 * <li>{@link StreamSupport#longStream(Spliterator.OfLong, boolean)}</li>
 * <li>{@link StreamSupport#longStream(Supplier, int, boolean)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @apiNote <p>
 * Internally, this stream wraps a {@code long} stream which is initially created in one of the static factory methods.
 * Whenever a non-terminal operation is called the underlying stream will be replaced with the result of calling the
 * same method on that stream. The return value of these operations is always this stream or, in case of operations
 * that return a different type of stream, one of {@link ParallelStreamSupport}, {@link ParallelIntStreamSupport} or
 * {@link ParallelDoubleStreamSupport}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Although each factory method returns a parallel stream, calling {@link #sequential()} is still possible and leads to
 * sequential execution of a terminal operation within the calling thread.
 * </p>
 * @implNote <p>
 * See the class documentation for {@link Stream} and the package documentation for
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html">java.util.stream</a> for
 * additional specification.
