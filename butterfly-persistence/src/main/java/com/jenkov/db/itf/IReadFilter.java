/**
 *  This interface represents the read filters that can be used in Butterfly Persistence.
 *  A read filter is used to limit the amount of records read, by having the filter
 *  not accept any records that are not desired to be read. This can be used to
 *  read pages of objects, for instance object 10-20 of a total <code>ResultSet</code>
 *  of 50 records.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 * It can also be used to just filter the <code>ResultSet</code>
 * further than was possible (or hard to do) in the SQL generating the <code>ResultSet</code>
 * in the first place. Also read filters can be combined, making it easier to have
 * filters that can be switched on and off. Easier than having to generate the SQL
 * for those kinds of on/off filterings.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 * Read filters are used when calling the functions of the object reader.
