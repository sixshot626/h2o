/**
 * This interface represents a mapping of a primary or foreing key in a database, to a
 * list of getter and setter mappings. This key mapping is a replacement for the
 * previous primary key mappings in the IObjectMapping interface. The previous
 * primary key mapping constructs did not support compound keys (multi-column keys).
 * The <code>IKey</code> supports that. In addition a <code>IKey</code>
 * can be used to map foreign keys too.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 * A key mapping consists of a table name and collections of getter and setter methods
 * that are mapped to the columns included in the key. For a primary key the table name
 * is the same table
 * as the key exists in. For a foreign key the table name is the table the primary key the
 * foreign key points to exists in.
